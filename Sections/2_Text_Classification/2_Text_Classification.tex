\section{Text Classification}
Text classification is an important part of NLP4Web. It has many applications and it's especially important to classify text to improve the date of the models.

\begin{greenbox}
    [Examples of Text Classification]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Spam Detection
        \item Sentiment Analysis
        \item Topic Labeling
        \item Age/Gender Identification
        \item Authorship Identification
        \item Language Identification
    \end{itemize}
\end{greenbox}

Some approaches to text classification are:

    [Approaches to Text Classification]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rule-Based
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Rules are "handcrafted" and human comprehensible
            \item As such precision can be high
            \item However it might also be very expensive to build and maintain as it needs to cover a lot of cases and handle changing languages
        \end{itemize}
        \item Supervised Learning
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Processes by which tagged/labeled data is picked and fed into an algorithm that then builds a model capaable of approximating text
            \item Can be human comprehensible - but doesn't need to be
            \item Easier to meaintain and fairly accurate
            \item Needs a lot of data
        \end{itemize}
        \item Unsupervised Learning (Deep Learning)
    \end{itemize}
